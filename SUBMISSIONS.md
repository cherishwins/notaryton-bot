## 4. TON Memelandia Application

**Project:**
```
MemeSeal - The meme coin proof machine
```

**Why We Fit Memelandia:**
```
MemeSeal is meme culture infrastructure.

Use case: Degen calls a meme coin pump in a group chat. 3 hours later, he's up 50x. Everyone asks "proof?"

With MemeSeal: He sealed the screenshot. On-chain. Timestamped. Verifiable forever.

"Proof or it didn't happen" isn't just our tagline - it's a meme coin survival skill.

We're not a meme coin. We're the tool that makes meme coin culture accountable.
```

**Traction:**
```
- Live on TON blockchain
- Processing real payments (Stars + TON)
- Weekly lottery with 500 Stars in current pot
- Twitter presence (@MemeSealTON)
- Multi-language (EN/RU/ZH) for global degen reach
```

**Ask:**
```
$10,000 for:
1. User acquisition (Telegram ads targeting meme coin groups)
2. Lottery pot seeding (bigger pots = more viral)
3. Meme content creation (frog-themed marketing)
```
