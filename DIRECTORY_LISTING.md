## TON Grant Application

### Project Summary

**MemeSeal** is a Telegram-native blockchain notarization service built on TON. Users can seal any file, screenshot, or document with a single tap, receiving permanent on-chain proof with a shareable verification link.

### Problem Statement

1. **Trust deficit in crypto** - Screenshots can be faked, claims are unverifiable
2. **Existing solutions are complex** - OpenTimestamps requires technical knowledge
3. **Enterprise tools are expensive** - OriginStamp requires contracts and high fees
4. **DIY requires dev skills** - Writing to blockchain manually is not accessible

### Solution

MemeSeal provides one-tap notarization directly in Telegram:
- Send any file to the bot
- Pay 1 Star or 0.015 TON
- Receive on-chain hash + verification link in <1 second

### Target Users

1. **Memecoin traders** - Prove entry/exit points
2. **NFT creators** - Prove "I made this first"
3. **OTC dealers** - Prove wallet balances
4. **DAO contributors** - Prove work completed
5. **Airdrop hunters** - Prove eligibility snapshots

### Why TON?

1. **Sub-second finality** - Instant user experience
2. **Low fees** - ~$0.02 per transaction enables micro-payments
3. **Telegram integration** - 900M+ users already in ecosystem
4. **Stars payment** - Frictionless payments without wallet setup

### Technical Architecture

```
User → Telegram Bot → Hash file (SHA256)
                   → Store hash on-chain via TON transaction
                   → Return verification URL
                   → Log to PostgreSQL for indexing
```
