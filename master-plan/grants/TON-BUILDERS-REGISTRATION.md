## Project Information

### Project Name
SealBet

### Tagline
Trustless Prediction Market Protocol for Telegram

### Category
DeFi / Telegram Mini Apps

### Description (Short)
The first non-custodial, peer-to-peer prediction market on TON. Trade event outcomes with no house edge, no custody risk, and verifiable track records via MemeSeal integration.

### Description (Long)
SealBet brings Polymarket-style prediction markets to Telegram's 950M users. Users trade YES/NO shares on event outcomes (crypto prices, sports, events) via bonding curve smart contracts.

Key differentiators:
- **Non-custodial**: Smart contracts hold all funds
- **Peer-to-peer**: No house edge, users trade with each other
- **Proof integration**: MemeSeal timestamps every prediction
- **Telegram-native**: Mini App with zero friction onboarding

Current status: Smart contracts built and tested, ready for testnet.
