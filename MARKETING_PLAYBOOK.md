## PART 2: PARTNERSHIP DMS

### Deploy Bot Creators (Revenue Share Pitch)

**Target bots to integrate with:**
- @memelaunchbot
- @tondeployer
- @toncoinbot
- @gaspump_bot
- Any new memecoin launchers

**DM Template:**
```
Hey! Love what you're building with [BOT NAME].

Quick pitch: I built MemeSeal - blockchain notarization for TON. When users deploy through your bot, they could instantly seal their launch as proof they were early/legit.

Integration idea:
- Add "Seal this launch" button after deploy
- User pays 1 Star or 0.001 TON
- You get 20% rev share on all seals through your bot

Already live: @MemeSealTON_bot
Demo: send any screenshot, watch it get sealed

Interested in chatting?
```

### Memecoin Project Owners

**Find them in:** gasPump chats, STON.fi, new launches

**DM Template:**
```
Yo! Saw your launch - congrats!

Quick alpha: You can seal your launch on-chain with @MemeSealTON_bot

Why it matters:
- Proves YOU deployed it (not a copycat)
- Immutable timestamp = credibility
- Verification link to share with community

Takes 5 seconds, costs 1 Star. Your buyers will trust you more.

Use code CHIMPWIN for a free seal to try it.
```
