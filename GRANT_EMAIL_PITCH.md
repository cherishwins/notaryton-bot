**Subject:** NotaryTON Grant Application - Trust Infrastructure for TON Launches

---

Hi TON Grants Team,

I built **NotaryTON** - trust infrastructure that creates immutable on-chain proof of smart contract state at launch time.

## The Problem
70%+ of TON memecoins are rugs or scams. Users have no way to verify what a contract looked like at launch, and bad actors face zero accountability.

## The Solution
NotaryTON lets anyone seal a contract's state in seconds:
1. Send contract address to @NotaryTON_bot
2. We hash the bytecode and record it on-chain
3. Anyone can verify the original state forever

## What's Live Now
- Telegram bot with Stars + TON payments
- Public verification API
- PostgreSQL backend (production-ready)
- Multi-language support (EN/RU/ZH)

## Traction
- [X] users registered
- [X] notarizations completed
- Working payments via Telegram Stars

## The Ask
$10K microgrant for:
- 3 launchpad integrations (Month 1)
- TonScan verification badges (Month 2)
- Security audit (Month 3)
