# MemeScan Litepaper

## The Problem

You're aping into meme coins blind.

- Dev rugged? You find out after.
- Whale dumping? You're the exit liquidity.
- New launch? You heard about it 3 hours late.

The information exists. It's just scattered across 47 Telegram groups, Discord servers, and some guy's Twitter thread you'll never find.

## The Solution

**MemeScan is Bloomberg Terminal for meme coins.**

One bot. All the alpha. Free.

```
/trending   → Top movers right now
/new        → Launches in the last hour
/check      → Safety score any token
/whale      → Big wallet movements
```

## How It Works

We aggregate data from:
- **STON.fi** - Real-time DEX data, pools, volume
- **TonAPI** - Holder distribution, wallet analysis
- **GeckoTerminal** - Price feeds, liquidity depth

Then we run it through safety analysis:
- Dev wallet % (>10% = warning)
- Top 10 holder concentration
- Liquidity depth vs market cap
- Contract verification status

You get a simple score: **SAFE** / **CAUTION** / **DANGER**

## Why Free?

Because the real money is in:

1. **Premium alerts** (coming) - Whale movements, insider wallets, launch sniping
2. **API access** (coming) - For traders who want raw data
3. **Ad slots** (coming) - Projects can pay for visibility

Free users = distribution = network effects = moat.

## The Team

Anonymous. Ships fast. Judges slow.

We're degens who got tired of getting rugged. Built this for ourselves. Now sharing it.
