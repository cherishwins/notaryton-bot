## Executive Summary

**MemeSeal** is a Telegram bot that timestamps files on the TON blockchain for 1 Star (~$0.02). Users get permanent, verifiable proof that a file existed at a specific moment in time.

**Status:** Live on mainnet, processing real payments.

**Ask:** $20,000 USD to scale user acquisition and seed viral lottery mechanics.

**Goal:** 10,000+ users and 1,000+ seals within 60 days.

## The Problem

### Crypto Culture Demands Receipts, But Proof Is Missing

**The Token Graveyard**
- 36,000 new tokens launch daily
- Most vanish within 2 weeks
- Bagholders are left ridiculed—without proof they ever called it

**Forgeable Screenshots = Distrust**
- Current "proof" (screenshots) is trivial to forge
- This fuels skepticism and kills community momentum
- The need for verifiable, on-chain receipts is critical

**The Gap**
Every trader who called a pump, every founder who announced a launch, every degen who made a prediction—none of them have provable, timestamped evidence.

*Proof or it didn't happen.*

## The Solution

### Three Steps to Permanent Proof

```
1. Forward any file to @MemeSealTON_bot
2. Pay 1 Star (costs less than 1 cent)
3. Receive TON blockchain hash + verification link
```

**Result:** Frictionless, irreversible, permanent proof.

### Why This Works

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Telegram-native | 900M users already have the app |
| Pay with Stars | Zero KYC, credit card via Apple/Google Pay |
| TON blockchain | Fast, cheap, permanent |
| Instant verification | Shareable link proves the timestamp |

## Traction

### Honest Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Monthly Active Users | 4 |
| Total Seals | 1 |
| Lottery Pot | 500 Stars (~$10) |
| Retention | 100% (small sample) |

### What This Means

We're early. The product works. We need users to scale.

The mechanics are proven:
- Payments process correctly
- Blockchain writes succeed
- Lottery pot grows with usage
- Users ask "when's the next draw?"

Grant money accelerates proven mechanics rather than financing experiments.
