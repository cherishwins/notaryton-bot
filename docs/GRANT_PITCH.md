## Why TON?

1. **Telegram Stars** = Zero-KYC credit card on-ramp. Users pay with Apple Pay, we get crypto. Magic.

2. **Telegram-native** = 900M users already have the app. No wallet download, no seed phrase, no friction.

3. **Fast & cheap** = Sealing costs ~0.001 TON. Users don't notice gas.

4. **Mini App ecosystem** = Built-in distribution via Telegram's app catalog.

## Use Cases (Real Demand)

| Who | Why They Seal |
|-----|---------------|
| Meme coin traders | Prove they called the pump before it happened |
| Crypto groups | Timestamp launch announcements, prevent FUD |
| Degens | "Receipts or GTFO" culture needs on-chain proof |
| Content creators | Copyright timestamps for original work |

## Business Model

```

```

## The Ask: $20,000 USD

| Use | Amount | Outcome |

| Telegram Ads | $12,000 | Target meme coin groups, 10K+ new users |
| Lottery Seeding | $5,000 | Bigger pots = viral FOMO |
| Infrastructure | $2,000 | Database scaling, redundancy |
