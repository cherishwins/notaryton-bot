### For Gamma.app / Canva / Google Slides:

**Slide 1: Title**
```
NotaryTON Labs
"Proof or it didn't happen"
Blockchain timestamping for the masses
```

**Slide 2: The Problem**
```
In crypto, trust is broken.
• Screenshots can be faked
• Timestamps can be edited
• Influencer calls can be deleted
• Without proof, it's just your word

$50B+ lost to rug pulls. Zero accountability.
```

**Slide 3: Our Solution**

1. Send any file to our Telegram bot

**Slide 5: How It Works**
```

                → Issues verification link

Anyone can verify. Forever.
